# TimeCheck
A python tool (initially a bunch of functions, later on a class with to check whether the current time lies in any configured time frame (stored in a XML file)

This is a framework which I use for my Raspberry project "powerswitch" (to be published).There it is used to detemine the on/off times for a routter which is switched on/off using an electronic relais.
