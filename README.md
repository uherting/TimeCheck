# TimeCheck
A python tool (initially a bunch of functions, later on a class with 
to check whether the current time lies in any configured time frame 
(stored in a XML file).

This is a framework which I plan to use for my Raspberry project 
"powerswitch" (to be published).There it is used to detemine the 
on/off times for a router which is switched on/off using an 
electronic relais.

This project is going to run on one of my Raspberry Pis.
